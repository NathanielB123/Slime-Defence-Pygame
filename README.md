# Slime-Defence-Pygame
 
A game I created at the start of the summer holidays but decided to upload now.
All instructions and credits are in the game.
Be aware it might be slightly buggy, especially on slow computers, the pathfinding algorithm is super inefficient and python is slow.

I am currently remaking this game in unity where it is looking to be a much smoother and overall better experience - should be done by Christmas.
