# Slime-Defence-Pygame
 
A game I created at the start of the summer holidays but decided to upload now.

A unique (to my knowledge) twist on standard tower-defence where you have to kill enemies to place walls, turrets and traps instead of purchasing and placing them directly.
All instructions and credits are in the game.
Be aware it might be slightly buggy, especially on slow computers; the pathfinding algorithm is super inefficient and python is slow.

I am currently remaking this game in unity where it is looking to be a much smoother and overall better and less buggy experience.

Installation:

Simply download, extract and run Slime Defence.exe to play the game

Notes on launching the game:

The game takes a while to launch - please wait around 10 seconds and don't click on the text window that first comes up.
The game will crash instantly if there is no available audio device; make sure you have speakers or headphones enabled and working if the game crashes.
The game may crash or look weird on resolutions other than 1920 by 1080.
